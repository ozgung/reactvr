A 3D scene based on React-Three

My resumÃ© on VR: http://ozgungenc.com/reactvr/

###Control###

#PC:
- use arrow keys to move the droid
- Use mouse to look around
- 'C' to center the droid back to scene

#Cardboard or VR headsets (not tested):
- Just look around

====

###Installation###

```
	> git clone git@github.com:ozgung/reactvr.git
	> cd reactvr
	> npm install
	> gulp
```

##TODO:
- Head tilt and movement for the droid
- Better controls
- Add server-side/Websockets support and evolve this into a multiplayer game.
